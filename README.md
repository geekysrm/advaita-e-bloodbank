### About the app:

The [e-bloodbank app](https://bloodbank-iiit.herokuapp.com/) is a life saver for the persons in need of blood. 
+ The app's landing page is a **split-screen view** containing: **'I need blood**' and '**I want to donate blood**'.
+ After clicking on the link on 'I want to donate blood' any healthy individual in the ages of 18-60 can easily register himself/herself as a donor with his geolocation. 
+ Now, after clicking on the link on 'I want to donate blood' when a person comes in search of blood of a particular blood group, he can view all those donors (having the blood groups from where he can accept) with their locations and phone numbers.
